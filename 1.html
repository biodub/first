Tests such as organs, tissues, cells, blood, and secretions of the human body are prepared, tested, analyzed, and tested by applying techniques such as coagulation and coloring. In order to investigate infection and observe the effects of various drugs on pathogens, experimental instruments such as microscopes, photoelectric non-color meters, and blood cell measurements are adjusted and operated.</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">The cause of the disease is found through diagnostic blood tests, microbial tests, transfusion medical tests, diagnostic molecular genetic tests, and immunosuppressive tests.
Various tests such as organs, tissues, cells, blood, and secretions of the human body are examined and analyzed using experimental instruments or reagents such as microscopes to test for disease, test for blood type, and calculate blood cell count.
Test reagents are prepared, blood is collected, manufactured, manipulated, and preserved, and the inspection and experimental process are accurately recorded and provided to doctors.</p>
